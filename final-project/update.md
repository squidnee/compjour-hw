#Progress made so far

So far, I have essentially fleshed out the basics. However, I am thinking about changing my focus, and am hesitant to proceed until I have worked that out. I will talk more about that in a sec.

Right now, I have begun creating the HTML and CSS pages, have created a controller to 'control' the data (in controller.py), and have created my app.py as usual. I also have a sql database of queries, though I'm not super familiar with SQL and may be using it completely wrong (and may not end up needing to use it at all...). I will be reading up on that soon.

I agree with your feedback, and have opted to go easy on the graphs at first. My current focus is on text data retrival, and I will see how I feel about graphs as time passes.

I will also try to keep track of my data in my repo here.

#Roadblocks

However, I am considering changing the focus of my project (and will meet with you on Wednesday about it -- I would have met today, but I had to pull an all-nighter the night before for something that wasn't related to school, so I opted to sleep in this morning). Essentially, I am shifting towards an interest in the personalities of those who *donate* the pizzas. I have found myself become increasingly interested in how people can be represented by the subreddits that they follow, and I am wondering if I could find anything by parsing the subreddit lists of the users who donate the pizzas to the original user. Since this is harder to find, I will stick with fleshing out the basics and mining some data on the requesters, but I hope to have this idea finalized by Wednesday.
